Publish a page using GitHub Pages that showcases your work. Ensure that your email address 23f1001906@ds.study.iitm.ac.in is in the page's HTML.

GitHub pages are served via CloudFlare which obfuscates emails. So, wrap your email address inside a:

<!--email_off-->23f1001906@ds.study.iitm.ac.in<!--/email_off-->
What is the GitHub Pages URL? It might look like: https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/

If a recent change that's not reflected, add ?v=1, ?v=2 to the URL to bust the cache.
