Let's make sure you can write formulas in Excel. Type this formula into Excel.
Note: This will ONLY work in Office 365.

=SUM(TAKE(SORTBY({9,2,3,12,9,8,2,2,0,15,12,13,10,3,11,1}, {10,9,13,2,11,8,16,14,7,15,5,4,6,1,3,12}), 1, 15))
What is the result?

Note: If you get #NAME? you have the wrong version of Excel. Find a friend for whom this works.
